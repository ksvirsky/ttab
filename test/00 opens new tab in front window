# Note: For most tests, we create the new tab in the front window, both because that is xtab's core feature (a simple `do script` without a target will open a tab in a new window).
#       Also, opening new tabs in the front window is less visually disruptive.
#       Note that while the tests terminate the new tab's shell, the tab may stay open, depending on its settings.
