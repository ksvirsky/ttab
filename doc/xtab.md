# xtab(1) - open a new Terminal.app / iTerm.app / Gnome Terminal tab or window

## SYNOPSIS

Opens a new terminal tab or window in OS X's Terminal application or iTerm2 or
Gnome Terminal on Ubuntu Linux.


    xtab [-w] [-s <settings>] [-t <title>] [-q] [-g|-G] [-d <dir>] [<cmd> ...]

    -w                  open new tab in new terminal window
    -s <settings>       assign a settings set (profile)
    -t <title>          specify title for new tab
    -q                  clear the new tab's screen
    -g                  create tab in background (don't activate Terminal/iTerm)
                        for gnome-terminal it opens tab in background without stealing focus
    -G                  create tab in background and don't activate new tab
                        for gnome-terminal it doesn't open any tab/window
    -d <dir>            specify working directory; -d '' disables inheriting
                        the current dir.
    -a Terminal|iTerm2  open tab or window in Terminal.app / iTerm2
    <cmd> ...           command to execute in the new tab
    "<cmd> ...; ..."    multi-command command line (passed as single operand)

Standard options: `--help`, `--man`, `--version`, `--home`

## DESCRIPTION

`xtab` opens a new Terminal or iTerm2 tab with a variety of options,
including executing a command in the new tab, assigning a title and working
directory, and opening the tab in a new window.

Note: iTerm2 support is experimental in that it is currently not covered by
the automated tests run before every release.

IMPORTANT: **Terminal/iTerm2 must be allowed assistive access** in order
for this  utility to work, which requires one-time authorization with
administrative privileges. If you get error messages instead of being prompted,
authorize the application via
System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility.

The new tab will run a login shell (i.e., load the user's shell profile)
and by default inherit the working directory from the parent shell.

When specifying a command to execute in the new tab, quoted parameters are
handled properly and there's no need to quote the command as a whole,
provided it is a *single* command.
Prefix such a single command with `exec` to exit the shell after the command
terminates. If the tab's settings are configured to close tabs on termination
of the shell, the tab will close automatically.

To specify *multiple* commands, pass them as a *single, quoted  string*.
Use `exit` as the last command to automatically close the tab when the
command terminates, assuming the tab's settings are configured to close the
tab on termination of the shell.
Precede `exit` with `read -rsn 1` to wait for a keystroke first.

## OPTIONS

 * `-w`
    creates the new tab in a new window rather than in the front
    window.

 * `-s <settings>`
    specifies the settings set (profile) to apply to the new tab, determining
    the appearance and behavior of the new tab.
    o Terminal: settings sets are defined in Preferences > Profiles;
    name matching is case-*in*sensitive, and specifying nonexistent settings
    causes an error.
    o iTerm2: profiles are defined in Preferences > Profiles; name matching
    is case-*sensitive*, and specifying a nonexistent profile causes an error.

 * `-t <title>`
    specifies a custom title to assign to the new tab; otherwise, if a
    command is specified, its first token will become the new tab's title.
    CAVEAT: As of iTerm2 v3.0.9, choosing a title that exactly matches the
    settings name specified with `-s` causes the title to be ignored.

 * `-d <dir>`
    explicitly specifies a working directory for the new tab; by default, the
    invoking shell's working directory is inherited (even if `-w` is also
    specified) - use `-d ''` to disable.

 * `-q`
    (*q*uiet) issues a `clear` command after opening the new tab.
    Note that output will temporarily be visible while the tab is being opened;
    also, clearing is not performed if any command passed reports an overall
    nonzero exit code, so as to allow failures to be examined.

 * `-g`
    (back*g*round) causes Terminal/iTerm2 not to activate, if it isn't the
    frontmost application); within the application, however, the new tab will
    become the active tab; useful in scripts that launch other applications and
    don't want Terminal/iTerm2 to steal focus later.

 * `-G`
    causes Terminal/iTerm2 not to activate *and* the active element within
    the application not to change; i.e., the active window and tab stay the
    same. If Terminal/iTerm2 happens to be frontmost, the new tab will
    effectively open in the background.

NOTE: With `-g` or `-G` specified, for technical reasons, Terminal/iTerm2 /
      the new tab will still activate *briefly, temporarily* in most scenarios.

* `-a Terminal` or `-a iTerm2`
    explicitly specifies the terminal application to use; by default, the
    terminal application from which this utility is run is implied, if
    supported, with Terminal used as the fallback.
    This options is useful for calling this utility from non-terminal
    applications such as Alfred (https://www.alfredapp.com/).

## STANDARD OPTIONS

All standard options provide information only.

 * `-h, --help`
    Prints the contents of the synopsis chapter to stdout for quick reference.

 * `--man`
    Displays this manual page, which is a helpful alternative to using `man`,
    if the manual page isn't installed.

 * `--version`
    Prints version information.

 * `--home`
    Opens this utility's home page in the system's default web browser.

## EXAMPLES

    # Open new tab in current terminal window:
    xtab

    # Open new tab in new terminal window:
    xtab -w

    # Open new tab with title 'Green' using settings (profile) 'Grass':
    xtab -t Green -s Grass

    # Open new tab and execute a command in it:
    xtab ls -l "$HOME/Library/Application Support"

    # Open new tab with specified working dir. and execute a command in it:
    xtab -d "$HOME/Library/Application Support" ls -l

    # Execute a command and exit.
    # If configured via the default profile, also close the tab.
    xtab exec /path/to/someprogram arg1 arg2

    # Pass a multi-command string as a single, quoted string, wait for a
    # keystroke, then exit.
    xtab 'ls "$HOME/Library/Application Support";
                                echo Press any key to exit; read -rsn 1; exit'

    # Create a new tab explicitly in iTerm2.
    xtab -a iTerm2 echo "Hi from iTerm2."
